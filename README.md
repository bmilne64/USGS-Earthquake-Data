#United States Geological Survey Earthquake Data

Earthquake Map Visualization: https://bmilne64.github.io/leaflet-challenge/

In this project, I utilized Leaflet to visualize an USGS earthquake dataset.Â First, I created a map that plotted all the earthquakes from the dataset based on their longitude and latitude. The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth appear darker in color. Popups provide additional information about the earthquake including the location, magnitude, depth and time when its associated marker is clicked. Additionally, I created a legend that provides context for the map data.
